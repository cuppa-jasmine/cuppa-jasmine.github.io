I watched Frances Ha over two or three nights, each time after I’d decided to stop packing for the day. Packing to leave my cozy home and loving friends in --------, packing to leave for towering and detached New York. And here was this girl Frances, living out the worst possible version of my future life in the city — with lots of acquaintances but only memories of friendship, struggling with rent and her job, wearing an oversized awkwardness. It could not be wrong because it was so accurate, the purposeful black-and-whiteness of this 2013 film recreating the cold whimsy and sharp-edged elegance that drew me to the city, putting its finger on the way I find the subway utterly romantic. Deep into the first night I paused the movie with a sinking feeling, determined not to watch any more. But of course I went back, if for no other reason than to know how miserably it ended. I can’t say I surfaced happy but I can say I surfaced hopeful. Aware of the vast possibilities offered by the rearrangement of thoughts, the reframing of perspectives. And reminded that fulfillment spans many dimensions, of which the spectrum of loneliness/lack thereof is only one.
