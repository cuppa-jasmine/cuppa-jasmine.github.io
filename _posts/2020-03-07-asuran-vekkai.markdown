*A note on the 2019 movie Asuran and Poomani’s novel Vekkai, which writer/director Vetri Maaran (VM) has adapted the film from (I read the book in translation and watched the movie with subtitles)*

Asuran was a terrific punch in my gut: above all, a visceral reminder of how caste attacks human dignity. This was a difficult movie to watch but also a difficult movie to stop watching. Young Chidambaram’s strong but devastated family pulled me deep into the hot and dusty landscape in which they ran from vile men, although I did frequently duck my head into my lap because I was completely unable to stomach gore. The whole cast was captivating, with Manju Warrier’s polished presence seemingly out of place at first but quickly replaced by her terrific/terrifying turn as a grieving mother.

The movie strikes a fine balance between entertainment and intensity. In spite of the serious themes, it’s a thriller with all the right elements. While (gentle spoilers) VM favours realism over a standard narrative arc, he does make an allowance to the rules of stardom by letting Dhanush win all the action sequences (end spoilers). I did find some of the dialogue stilted (as per my partial Tamil comprehension and the English subtitles) and VM has voiced his own disappointment at the visible rush in which he was forced to wrap the film up. Neither of those, though, takes too much away from this essential movie.

Reading Vekkai after watching Asuran was disorienting but rewarding. The same characters participate in the same pivotal events, yet these form the hinges of a completely different narrative. Even as the two plots diverged, I did not doubt that these were the same protagonists embroiled in a parallel set of events, and so Vekkai deepened my empathy for Asuran’s Chidambaram in some contradictory but surprisingly effective way. As in the film, the novel has Chidambaram and his father on the run in scrubby semi-wilderness. I bit my nails as I read, expecting pursuers or violent flashbacks to attack them every time I turned a page, but soon realized that those elements are entirely besides the point in this tale of survival and companionship. 

If Asuran is a chase and a battle for survival, Vekkai is a meditation on the love, indignation and routines that sustain those who run and fight.
