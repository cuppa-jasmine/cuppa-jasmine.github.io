Reading Exquisite Cadavers was a lot like learning to ride a bicycle. Meena Kandasamy’s latest novel is structured into two columns: there’s a fictional narrative, and then a log of the thoughts and influences driving its creation. Eager not to get too caught up with either thread, I channeled a fair amount of effort into shifting back and forth between the two. And unexpectedly, I found this fatiguing a mental muscle that’s usually flexed not by reading, but when I’m teaching myself to do something more dexterous like knit or, yes, ride a bicycle.

For all my diligence, though, I did repeatedly lose balance and tumble headlong into one or the other column. The main story, styled as a series of vignettes about film student Karim and his partner Maya, would tug me in with its lyricism — the English language is butter-soft to MK’s touch — and incisive portrayal of overlapping themes:  the process and politics of art, identity and immigration, love and family and domesticity. But more often than not, I lost myself in the margins, fascinated by this rare invitation to watch the ticker tape of ideas fueling a work of art.

The slim novel comes with another invitation too, this one explicit. MK wrote Exquisite Cadavers in a freewheeling flow, determined only to keep the plot entirely fictional (one note in the margins demands *‘no seepage, no bleeding’* from life). Keen to understand how this has turned out, she welcomes us to examine the results:

> Have the margins always remained disciplined? Have they exhibited any tendency to respect my decision to cautiously separate the fictional and the real? Did I manage to evade my activism by living abroad and staying in the margins?
> This book is the result of my journey of trying to find out. Come, join me, dear reader.

The warmth in that last sentence struck me, especially because this experiment was informed by an encounter with disrespectful readership: to the audience which rejected her own designation of a previous work about domestic violence as auto*fiction* (a blend of personal experience and fiction) to call it a memoir, MK returns with an outstretched hand. And, alright, some stinging retorts. 

From early on, there is evidence of bleeding and seepage. The author tells us that she has placed Maya and Karim in London as part of an effort to make the city her home. And her contentions with responses to the autofiction novel

> No one discusses process with us. 

> No one discusses our work in the framework of the novel as an evolving form.

surely work their way into Karim’s experiences at university?

> Sadly, satire and sarcasm, mocking and lampooning are all preserves of equals – someone like him will always be taken only at face-value […] these critics carry forward his work, give it lustre and texture, lend it their white-white seal of approval so that he, animal-hearted African, desert-stranded Arabian in their eyes, can be let loose into the world, allowed to forage for the story he is after.

But here’s something else. Even when the margins drip with frustration or guilt or wrath, literally spilling over with timelines of sexual violence or news about a friend’s political arrest, the story stays paced, deliberate. MK might use an idea from those notes in a page, or in ten pages when you aren’t expecting it any more, or never. As the plot progresses, this is the emergent triumph, cast into the light by Exquisite Cadaver’s split-column structure: the author’s command on the narrative, over every infusion she allows into it.

I, for one, often believe an artist’s biases and intentions are *so obvious* without realizing the leaps of logic my conclusions involve. I’d certainly have taken the Mixed Marriages chapter to be reflective of MK’s own life if she hadn’t documented her research — basketsful of public opinion and scholarly wisdom from Britain — in the margins. To readers with such tendencies, the novel delivers a sure-footed call for reflection.  Even as the observations became sharper,

> [...] Maya says Karim spends his time at home making pressure-cooker bombs. They are the only ones laughing.

> The problem with jokes is that not everyone is allowed to make them, and not everyone is obliged to find them funny. 

it was the chance to read text and margins side by side, to realize the amounts of design and distillation separating the two, that kept me hooked.
