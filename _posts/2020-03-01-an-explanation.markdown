From my earlier schoolgirl encounter with Persepolis, I only remember the (female) protagonist/author trying to pee standing up. I devoured my aunt’s copy of the graphic novel when I visited her recently, and am still trying to organize my thoughts about the very engrossing narrative.

One highlight of this time’s read was watching jasmine blossoms tumble from the cups of an older woman’s bra as she undressed for bed. Apparently she’d placed them there for their fragrance, I am currently *obsessed* with the idea.

And then, today, I found some lovely words about such obsessions in an [old column](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/opinion/columnists/paromita-vohra/Tera-Gajra-Re/articleshow/45904106.cms) Paromita Vohra wrote about the everyday sensuality of wearing gajra. On the recent shift from strings of real flowers to cloth/plastic look-alikes, she laments that these are:

> “… more for display than for play, adorned by flowers that look good, but have no perfume that makes smiling, layered suggestions of mutual desire.”

(I also enjoy a cup of jasmine tea.)
