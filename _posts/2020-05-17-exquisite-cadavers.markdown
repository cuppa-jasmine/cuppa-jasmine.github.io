Meena Kandasamy’s Exquisite Cadavers is written as an experiment, one that’s still on when it’s being read. Accompanying MK’s latest novel is a careful documentation of the thoughts driving its creation. Since these notes run parallel to the main text instead of interjecting into it, the reader must develop a strategy for shifting between the two columns of text. And that’s tricky because each is fascinating in its own right — one for the incisive and stylish prose, the other as a rare and intimate window into the author’s process.

The novel is styled as a series of snapshots, varied in angle and texture but always framing the same two Londoners: Karim, who is studying film, and Maya, his partner. MK is determined to keep it entirely fictional, a note in the margin demands ‘no seepage, no bleeding’ from life into fiction. And excitingly, she invites us to be active researchers in this study she’s set up:

> "Have the margins always remained disciplined? Have they exhibited any tendency to respect my decision to cautiously separate the fictional and the real? Did I manage to evade my activism by living abroad and staying in the margins? This book is the result of my journey of trying to find out. Come, join me, dear reader."

The warmth in that last sentence is striking, especially because MK designed this experiment after an encounter with disrespectful readership. To the audience who rejected her own designation of a previous work as auto-fiction to call it a memoir (*When I Hit You: Or, A Portrait of the Author as a Young Wife*), she returns with an outstretched hand, another work of art, and... just when you thought she was wasn’t going to mention it, some stinging and well-directed barbs. 

The author tells us how she created the two characters: Karim is inspired by an immigrant filmmaker couple whose work she stumbled upon and Maya is a ‘suitably English’ counterpoint. She also tells us that she has placed Maya and Karim in London as part of an effort to make the city her own home -- seepage? Soon after, the margins begin to carry MK's contentions with critics’ responses to *When I Hit You*.

> "No one discusses process with us. No one discusses our work in the framework of the novel as an evolving form."

… and then, as Karim’s colleagues at university begin to behave similarly, these scribbles begin to bleed onto the other half of the page.

> "Sadly, satire and sarcasm, mocking and lampooning are all preserves of equals – someone like him will always be taken only at face-value […] these critics carry forward his work, give it lustre and texture, lend it their white-white seal of approval so that he, animal-hearted African, desert-stranded Arabian in their eyes, can be let loose into the world, allowed to forage for the story he is after."

Does this mean the experiment has failed? Certainly, the author has allowed fiction to chew away at her reality. But there is a different triumph here, scaffolded by the novel’s ingenious structure: we see MK’s absolute command over the narrative, over every infusion she allows into it. Even when the margins drip with frustration or guilt or wrath, literally spilling over with timelines of sexual violence or news of a friend’s political arrest, the prose remains deliberate, unhurried. The author might refer back to these ideas in a page, or in ten pages (once the reader has judged that they weren’t important enough to go in after all) or never.

The novel is, then, a challenge issued. To those who think the novelist writes purely from experience or on impulse, to those who believe they know the workings of an author’s mind better than the author does herself. A later chapter called Mixed Marriages considers the effect of Maya and Karim’s intercultural union on their interactions with friends and family. I would’ve taken the bait and read this as a fictionalized account of the author’s own experiences if it weren’t for the research notes in the margins – which do dip briefly into MK’s memories, but primarily excavate basketsful of British public opinion and scholarly wisdom. This doesn’t make the observations any less scathing; instead, they fit right into themes the author’s drawn from her own life.

> "Maya says Karim spends his time at home making pressure-cooker bombs. They are the only ones laughing.
The problem with jokes is that not everyone is allowed to make them, and not everyone is obliged to find them funny." 

Maya and Karim’s story explores a range of themes: identity and immigration, the process and the politics of art, love and family.

> "The Prevent programme is not something that is being run at educational institutions and large employers alone; every white person in this country seems to have taken training lessons in sniffing out terrorists."

The English language is soft to MK’s powerful touch, and the novel draws you in, inviting multiple rereads. Most fascinating, though, is the chance to read text and margins side by side, to realize the amounts of design and distillation separating the two. It’s the juxtaposition against its own margins that pushes this one firmly into masterpiece territory.
